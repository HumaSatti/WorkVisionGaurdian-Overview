 🚀 Excited to share the architecture of my latest project — **WorkVisionGuardian**  
  
 An AI-powered, privacy-first platform for workplace productivity analytics.  
 It processes secure camera feeds using deep learning to detect real-time activities  
 and correlate with business KPIs — all within a zero-trust, GDPR-compliant architecture.  
  
 🔹 Tech Stack: Python · PyTorch · OpenCV · FastAPI · React · Flutter · Docker · Kubernetes  
 🔹 Security: End-to-end encryption, role-based access, zero-trust architecture  
 🔹 Compliance: GDPR & consent-first design  
  
 Source is private — but the architecture and concept are public here
